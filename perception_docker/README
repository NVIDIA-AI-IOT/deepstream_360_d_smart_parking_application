This document describes the steps involved to run the 360d app using the docker image.

1) After cloning the project, download videos from https://nvidia.app.box.com/s/ezzw0js1ti555vbn3swsggvepcsh3x7e and place it in a directory named 'videos' inside the directory 'perception_docker'.

2) Login to Nvidia container registry (nvcr.io)
 $ docker login nvcr.io

 Enter the username as $oauthtoken and copy your NGC APIKey as the password.
 Note that the login is sticky and does not have to be repeated every time.
 Refer to https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/ngc-getting-started-guide/index.html for more information. 

3) Execute the run.sh command (sudo maybe required depending on how docker is configured on your system)


4) When the container starts up, edit config file to set broker url (if required).
To do so first install and editor (eg: nano)
  $ apt-get update
  $ apt-get install nano

5) enable logging (optional)

~# DeepStream360d_Release/sources/tools/nvds_logger/setup_nvds_logger.sh 

Note: the log severity level can be edited in the setup script if desired
-- set to 7 if logging of entire messages is required

6) run the 360d app
Eg:
~# deepstream-360d-app -c DeepStream360d_Release/samples/configs/deepstream-360d-app/source10_gpu0.txt 


Note: if there is an error that looks like below, then the broker address is not valid.

ERROR from nvmsgbroker: Could not configure supporting library.
Debug info: gstnvmsgbroker.c(325): gst_nvmsgbroker_start (): /GstPipeline:pipeline/GstNvMsgBroker:nvmsgbroker:
